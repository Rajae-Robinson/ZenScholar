      <p>
        Welcome to the online platform dedicated to exploring the acceptability
        and perceptions of online screening to address depression among Jamaican
        university students.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Our Team</h2>
      <p>
        We are a dedicated team of students from the University of Technology,
        Jamaica, comprising Dominique Briscoe, Jada Walters, Lashea Beaton,
        Rajae Robinson, and Tyreque Hibbert. Under the supervision of Ms. Muir,
        we embarked on this journey as part of our PRJ4020: Major Project,
        commencing in January 2024.

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        In an era where mental health is gaining recognition as a critical
        component of overall well-being, we recognized the pressing need to
        address depression among university students in Jamaica. Our mission is
        twofold: first, to assess the feasibility and acceptability of utilizing
        online screening tools to detect depression among Jamaican university
        students, and second, to explore the perceptions surrounding digital
        mental health interventions within this demographic.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">
        Why This Project Matters
      </h2>
      <p>
        Depression is not just a global health concern; it&apos;s a local one
        too. With alarming statistics indicating its prevalence among Jamaicans,
        particularly within the university student population, our project aims
        to shine a light on this issue. By bridging the gap between traditional
        mental health interventions and the digital landscape, we aspire to
        offer tailored support to those in need and contribute to the
        development of culturally sensitive mental health resources in Jamaica.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Our Approach</h2>
      <p>
        Through rigorous research and collaboration with mental health
        professionals, we aim to delve deep into the acceptability and
        practicality of online screening tools. By soliciting feedback and
        insights from Jamaican university students themselves, we seek to
        understand their perceptions of digital mental health interventions and
        identify potential benefits and challenges associated with such
        platforms.
