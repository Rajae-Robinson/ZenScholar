          Welcome to the online platform dedicated to exploring the

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Our Mission</h2>
        <p className="text-base">
          In an era where mental health is gaining recognition as a critical
          component of overall well-being, we recognized the pressing need to
          address depression among university students in Jamaica. Our mission
          is twofold: first, to assess the feasibility and acceptability of
          utilizing online screening tools to detect depression among Jamaican
          university students, and second, to explore the perceptions
          surrounding digital mental health interventions within this
          demographic.

          Why This Project Matters
        </h2>
        <p className="text-base">
          Depression is not just a global health concern; it&apos;s a local one
          too. With alarming statistics indicating its prevalence among
          Jamaicans, particularly within the university student population, our
          project aims to shine a light on this issue. By bridging the gap
          between traditional mental health interventions and the digital
          landscape, we aspire to offer tailored support to those in need and
          contribute to the development of culturally sensitive mental health
          resources in Jamaica.
        </p>

        <br></br>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Our Approach</h2>
        <p className="text-base">
          Through rigorous research and collaboration with mental health
          professionals, we aim to delve deep into the acceptability and
          practicality of online screening tools. By soliciting feedback and
          insights from Jamaican university students themselves, we seek to
          understand their perceptions of digital mental health interventions
          and identify potential benefits and challenges associated with such
          platforms.
